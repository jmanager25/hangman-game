## How To Play 

To start playing the player must enter their name and then press enter. 
The player is shown a set o blank spaces that match a word and he/she has to guess the letters or word in order to reveal the hidden word. If the player input the letter that is in the word, that letter is revealed, however if the letter is not in the word, then a stickman is slowly drawn. With each wrong letter guess, the man is drawn more and more and after 5 wrong attempts the man is hung and the game is lost. If the player guess the word before the 5 attempts then the full word is revealed and he/she wins. 

If the player input an invalid character, an error message is displayed and is asked again to input their choice.
