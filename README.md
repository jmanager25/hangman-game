## How To Play 

To start playing, the player must enter their name and then press enter. 
The player is shown a set of blank spaces that match a word and has to guess the letters or word in order to reveal the hidden word. If the player inputs the letter that is in the hidden word, that letter is revealed, however if the letter is not in the word, then a stickman is slowly drawn. With each wrong guess, the man is drawn more and more and after 7 wrong attempts the man is hung and the game is lost. If the player guess the word before the 7 wrong attempts then the full word is revealed and the player wins. 

If the player enters an invalid character, an error message is displayed and the player is asked again to input their choice.
